# CLI_Over_Web

This is a simple replica of the Linux RHEL8 Command Line Interface with some of the basic functionalities demonstrated in the video.
There can be more things we can do that are
creating any directory on the server
any files over the server and much more.

A small API was created which works on the backend along with the Common Gateway Interface which runs the Python Script for us and renders the output onto the UI.
